    " Test the hypothesis that the mean scores of all the students are the same. If not, name the student with the highest score. To test the hypothesis that the mean scores of all the students are the same, we can use a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). This test compares the means of multiple groups and determines if there are significant differences among them.\n",
